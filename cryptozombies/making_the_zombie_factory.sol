/* Build a "Zombie Factory" to build an army of zombies.
Our factory will maintain a database of all zombies in our army.
Our factory will have a function for creating new zombies.
Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance. 
The zombie's appearance will be based on its "Zombie DNA". Zombie DNA is simple â€” it's a 16-digit integer, like: 8356281049284737
The first 2 digits map to the zombie's head type, the second 2 digits to the zombie's eyes, etc.
For now, our zombies can have only 7 different types of heads (even though 2 digits allow 100 possible options)
For example, the first 2 digits of our example DNA above are 83. To map that to the zombie's head type, we do 83 % 7 + 1 = 7. So this Zombie would have the 7th zombie head type.
